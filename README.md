## üìù About The Project

`push_swap` is a classic algorithm project from the 42 school curriculum. The goal is to sort a stack of unique integers using a limited set of instructions and a second, auxiliary stack. The challenge is not just to sort the numbers, but to do so in the minimum number of moves.

This project tests your understanding of algorithms, data structures (stacks), and optimization. The program (`push_swap`) takes a list of integers as input and outputs a sequence of operations to sort them.

## üéØ The Challenge

You are given two stacks, `a` and `b`:
-   **Stack `a`**: Contains a random list of unique integers.
-   **Stack `b`**: Is initially empty.

The goal is to sort stack `a` in ascending order (with the smallest number at the top) using the allowed operations. The program should be efficient and use the fewest possible instructions.

## ‚ú® Allowed Operations

Only the following operations are permitted to manipulate the stacks:

| Operation | Description                                                               |
| :-------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    `sa`   | **Swap a**: Swaps the first two elements at the top of stack `a`.           |
|    `sb`   | **Swap b**: Swaps the first two elements at the top of stack `b`.           |
|    `ss`   | Performs `sa` and `sb` at the same time.                                  |
|    `pa`   | **Push a**: Takes the top element from stack `b` and moves it to stack `a`.|
|    `pb`   | **Push b**: Takes the top element from stack `a` and moves it to stack `b`.|
|    `ra`   | **Rotate a**: Shifts all elements of stack `a` up by one. The first becomes the last. |
|    `rb`   | **Rotate b**: Shifts all elements of stack `b` up by one. The first becomes the last. |
|    `rr`   | Performs `ra` and `rb` at the same time.                                  |
|    `rra`  | **Reverse rotate a**: Shifts all elements of stack `a` down by one. The last becomes the first. |
|    `rrb`  | **Reverse rotate b**: Shifts all elements of stack `b` down by one. The last becomes the first. |
|    `rrr`  | Performs `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.                                |

## üß† The Algorithm

The sorting strategy depends on the size of the stack:

-   **For small stacks (2, 3, or 5 numbers):** A set of hardcoded, optimal instructions is used to sort the numbers quickly.

-   **For larger stacks:** A "chunking" or "radix-like" approach is implemented:
    1.  **Indexing**: First, the numbers are assigned a sorted index.
    2.  **Push to B**: Numbers are pushed from stack `a` to stack `b` in chunks. For example, the first chunk might contain the first 20 numbers (by index). This is done until stack `a` only contains a few sorted elements.
    3.  **Push back to A**: The algorithm then finds the "cheapest" number in stack `b` to move back to `a`. The cost is calculated based on the number of rotations needed to bring that number to the top of `b` and prepare `a` for its arrival. This process is repeated until stack `b` is empty and `a` is fully sorted.

This method ensures that the numbers are pushed back to `a` in the correct order efficiently.

## üöÄ How To Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/murdex5/push_swap.git
    cd push_swap
    ```

2.  **Compile the project:**
    The project includes `ft_printf` as a dependency. The `Makefile` will handle its compilation.
    ```sh
    make
    ```

3.  **Run the program:**
    Execute `push_swap` with a list of numbers as arguments.
    ```sh
    ./push_swap 4 67 3 8 2
    ```

4.  **Check the output (Optional):**
    The project may include a `checker` program to verify the sorting instructions. You can pipe the output of `push_swap` into the `checker`.
    ```sh
    ARG="4 67 3 8 2"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
    ```
    If the output is `OK`, the stack was sorted correctly. If `KO`, there was an error. You can also see the number of instructions with `wc -l`.
    ```sh
    ./push_swap $ARG | wc -l
    ```

## üí° Example

```sh
# Generate a list of numbers and run push_swap
$ ARG="8 5 3 9 2 1"; ./push_swap $ARG
pb
pb
pb
sa
pb
ra
pa
pa
pa
pa

# Check if the output correctly sorts the stack
$ ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
OK

# Count the number of instructions
$ ./push_swap $ARG | wc -l
      10
```
